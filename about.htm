<h3>Gallery Without Walls</h3>
<p>
Follow Your Art! throughout downtown Lake Oswego. In partnership with the City of Lake Oswego, 
the Arts Council of Lake Oswego is pleased to introduce the newest works of art in the rotating <i>Gallery Without Walls</i> exhibition-works that 
will delight and enrich our community for the next two years. Accessible to community members and visitors alike, 
the new sculptures celebrate creativity and innovation.
</p>
<p>
Over sixty rotating and permanent sculptures are included in the <i>Gallery Without Walls.</i> 
The rotating sculptures are on-loan from artists of national and international acclaim for a two-year period, 
and are for sale. A volunteer committee works for a year to select the artwork, balancing the exhibition to include a
 wide variety of concepts, forms and materials. Many of our local businesses sponsor the sculptures for the two year period.
</p>

<h3>About the App</h3>
<p>Volunteer Brian Strull, with assistance from Joy Strull, 
developed this app featuring the <i>Gallery Without Walls</i> sculpture.  Bonnie Schlieman and Pat Vessely wrote the copy for each sculpture on the tour, and Deb Hollister photographed all the artwork and created the app icon and splash screen.  The splash screen features Keith Jellum's Vincent (iPhone) and Alisa Formway Roe's August Trunk (iPad).
</p>
<p>
The app showcases a number of different tours, including Abstracts, People and Animals. The app allows one to find 
the nearest sculpture, read the sculpture description, link to the artist&#39;s website, and link to the sponsor&#39;s website.  Tap 
the map icon to view a map and access walking directions.
</p>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p> 
The app requires an internet connection to download the latest list of artwork, and optionally 
uses your GPS to locate the nearest work of art or provide walking directions.
